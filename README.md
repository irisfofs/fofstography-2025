This is a vanilla-focused modpack; the focus is meant to be building cool stuff and taking pictures (with the Exposure mod).

It has Create, but there's minimal progression beyond vanilla, and (almost) no structure mods. Lots of food mods though. (Okay there's a little extra stuff to zhuzh it up but the main focus is on building.) Nothing some of you haven't seen before and that's kind of the point: to make the fun come from hanging out with friends and building things, rather than getting sick loot.

## Installation

Download the modpack from https://ink.horse/minecraft/Fofstography%202025.zip. Import it into [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/). packwiz will do the rest when you launch it.

### Specific tweaks

- [Jade](https://modrinth.com/mod/jade) (WAILA) is installed, you just have to hold <kbd>Left Alt</kbd> to show it. (You can change this in the config if you want but I thought it'd be a fun default.)
- [Xaero's World Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map) is on <kbd>.</kbd>, but cave mode and entity radar are disabled.
- [Freecam](https://modrinth.com/mod/freecam) is on <kbd>F4</kbd>.
- [Simple Voice Chat](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat) is included; press <kbd>V</kbd> after joining if it doesn't prompt you to set it up.
